This is a simple project I made mostly to finally finish something:P
Other than that I wanted to know how much time I spend programming each session
##hotkeys:
- F - start/stop the timer
- S - save
- P - pause/unpause

If you want to save your session you HAVE TO press S. Pressing F after starting the timer
will delete the record
